# RStudio Assessment

The following scenarios are covered in the spec.cy.js file.

-Creating a Space

-Creating a Project within the Space

-Verifying that the RStudio IDE loads


I also added logic to delete the previously created space so that the tests can run again without issues. I wanted to make this better, but I started going over the suggested 4 hour timeframe, and wanted to get this back to you sooner rather than later to hopefully show my eager interests in growing and learning in the position and with the company.
